              If youâ€™re looking to build a career in law, you can choose from a
              variety of undergraduate LLB programs such as BA LLB, BBA LLB,
              BLS-LLB, BSc LLB, or BCom LLB. These courses are designed to
              provide a strong foundation in legal studies, and their duration
              typically spans five years. 
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#31393C]">During the program, students gain an
              in-depth understanding of constitutional law, criminal law,
              corporate law, and international legal systems, along with
              practical training through moot courts, legal aid camps, and
              internships. Graduates can pursue careers as advocates, legal
              advisors, corporate counsels, or judicial officers, or continue
              their education with specialized LLM or diploma programs in fields
              like intellectual property law, cyber law, or human rights.</p>
