              PhD courses in India provide advanced research opportunities in
              various fields, allowing students to explore topics deeply and
              contribute new ideas to their area of study. To pursue a PhD,
              candidates usually need a Masterâ€™s degree with good grades and
              must clear entrance exams like UGC-NET, CSIR-NET, or
              university-specific tests, followed by an interview. The duration
              of a PhD typically ranges from three to six years and includes
              coursework, research work, and thesis submission.
